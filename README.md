# Graphs-Research

## Description

This GitHub repository, titled "Graphs Research," is dedicated to the collection and analysis of real-world data modeled through graphs. The focus is on utilizing graph theory to gain insights and understand the relationships and structures inherent in the collected data. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the process of collecting data, modeling it into graphs, and performing various analyses to derive meaningful conclusions.

## Introduction

The "Graphs Research" project aims to demonstrate how real-world data can be transformed into graph representations and analyzed to uncover insights. The example used in this project involves collecting data such as students' favorite artists, identifying connections between students based on shared preferences, and analyzing the most frequently co-occurring artists and the most connected individuals.

## Data Collection

In this project, data is collected in a manner suitable for graph modeling. For instance, a survey might be conducted to gather information on students' top ten favorite artists. This data is then prepared and organized for graph construction.

## Graph Modeling

The collected data is modeled into various types of graphs. The main steps include:

- **Creating Nodes and Edges**: Representing students and artists as nodes, and preferences as edges connecting them.
- **Graph Types**: Constructing different types of graphs, such as co-occurrence graphs to show how often artists appear together in students' lists.
- **Matrix Representations**: Generating incidence, similarity, and co-occurrence matrices from the data.

## Graph Analysis

The analysis phase involves calculating several key metrics and properties of the graphs, including:

- **Vertex Identification**: Identifying vertices (students and artists).
- **Edge Identification**: Identifying edges (connections based on shared preferences).
- **Degree Calculation**: Calculating the degree of each vertex.
- **Graph Density**: Determining the density of the graph.
- **Connectivity Analysis**: Analyzing the strength and intensity of connections between vertices.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, the following are required:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, networkx
